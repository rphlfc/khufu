# Khufu - A Decentralized Pyramid Scheme

## Attention
**A pyramid is a fraudulent scheme and should be not be considered a valid investment strategy.
This project was created for studying purposes only.**

## How it works?
In order to join the scheme you have to pay 0.01 ETH. Once in the scheme, 10% of your admission 
payment (0.0001 ETH) will be fowarded to your referral address. By joining the scheme you automatically earn
1 GIZA. Think of the GIZA token as the merchandise that you get once you join a pyramid scheme.

In order to make real money you'd have to sell your GIZA token for more than you paid for it (0.0001 ETH).
But guess what, selling a GIZA token can be very difficult. You don't know where to sell or whom to sell it
to. Soon you'll realize that getting more people to join the scheme is a lot more profitable than selling the
merchandise (your GIZA tokens).

And there you have it, a pyramid scheme. You are going to need to talk people into joining the scheme and 
use your address as their referral address so you can earn your 10% fee from their admission payments.

Any resemblance with the reality is mere coincidence. ðŸ™ƒ
